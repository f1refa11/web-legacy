# web-legacy
A **VERY** old website of mine, created at around 20th March 2020

#### The reason to upload the code there is because previously i used free hosting 000webhost to host this website but suddenly the hosting decided to take my site down because of "resource abuse"(??? i don't remember the reason clearly).

Some notes for this site:
- it's **RUSSIAN** localization only website as back then i didn't know english well :\ you can try some translators but their result might be different.
- this code didn't have any changes after the site got taken down - only pure 2020 web design *made by meüíÖ*. but:
- **there can be a LOT of poor css/html/js code**, pls don't blame me, at that time i just started learning css/html.
- there are some **music**(üò®). just 14 tracks of my first album "Infinity waves" you can check though.
- there are **g a m e s** and *programs*. when i was making those projects i took some screenshots of some, so you can now see them without downloading a repo üëç. 
  - game - danger, available [here](https://github.com/f1refa11/danger). 
  - **very cringe game** - minepy, very simple text *unfinished* game based on Minecraft game playthrough which lets a user make choices to completing a game. not recommended to play, **VERY NOT RECOMMENDED** to check the sources(written in python).
  - programs - batcreator and pygenerator - apps written in Tkinter which lets you create an batch/python script without writing code. i don't know their statuses, may be both unfinished. sources available.
  - program - pygenerator(or pyrandom) - pretty simple password generator. may also be unfinished and have some cool features, so check it out.
  - game - opencanvas - simple multiplayer drawing canvas with (probably) room system. was written in Construct whose site is used by game engine to handle connections. can be laggy at some cases. very unfinished project but worth trying

if i find other project i'll add it.
Unfortunately there are some projects whose files are not included in repo. But if i found some of them i'll update the README.
